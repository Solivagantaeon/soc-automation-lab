# Runbook: n8n triage workflow

How to build, test and fix every node of the  workflow. The reasons behind each choice are in ADR 0003.



<!--
How to fill in your stage:
- One subsection per node, in the order the nodes run. Copy the node template below.
- Screenshot every node's settings and one successful test. Save them as
  docs/images/n8n/<issue>-<node-name>.png and check them with scripts/check_images.py --ocr.
  No keys, tokens, webhook URLs or real usernames on screenshots.
- Settings table: write the value you typed or selected. For credentials, write only the credential name.
- "If it does not work": every problem you hit while building, with what fixed it.

## 1. Webhook

**Owner:** @MKonrad-afk

**What it does:** Receives Wazuh alerts as JSON over an authenticated HTTP POST request and immediately acknowledges receipt.

**How to build it:**

1. Add a Webhook node to the n8n workflow.
2. Set **HTTP Method** to `POST`.
3. Set **Authentication** to `Header Auth` and select the existing `Wazuh webhook token` credential.
4. Set **Respond** to `Immediately`.
5. Publish the workflow and configure the Wazuh `custom-n8n` integration to send JSON alerts to the production Webhook URL.
6. Set the Wazuh integration threshold to level 12. This forwards alerts at level 12 and above.

**Wazuh integration configuration:**

To set the wazuh integration threshold - Connect to the Wazuh manager and edit `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`. In the existing `custom-n8n` integration block, replace the rule-ID filter with this minimum-level filter:

```xml
<level>12</level>
```
This is a minimum threshold, so alerts at level 12 and above are forwarded. The integration continues to send JSON alerts. Keep the existing Webhook URL and authentication value in the server configuration; do not add them to the repository.

After saving the file, restart the Wazuh manager and check its status:
```xml
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
sudo systemctl is-active wazuh-manager
```
Expected output:
```xml
active
```

**Webhook node settings:**
| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| HTTP Method | `POST` |
| Authentication | `Header Auth` |
| Credential | `Wazuh webhook token` |
| Respond | `Immediately` |
| Wazuh alert format | JSON |
| Wazuh minimum level | `12` |

**How to test it:** Generate a long-URL test request from Kali to the lab web server. Wazuh should create rule `31115` at level `13`, and n8n should record a successful execution after receiving the alert.

To generate such test - Run this on Kali with `python3`:

```python
python3 - <<'PY'
from urllib.request import urlopen

url = "http://10.10.10.100/?probe=" + "A" * 8000

with urlopen(url, timeout=10) as response:
    print(f"HTTP {response.status}")
PY
```

![Successful n8n execution for the test alert](../images/n8n/66-webhook-test.png)

![Webhook output showing the received Wazuh alert](../images/n8n/66-webhook-payload.png)


The test on 2026-11-02 produced the Wazuh alert at 23:36:28 and a successful n8n execution at 23:36:30, completed in 4.066 seconds.


**If it does not work:**

| What you see | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Wazuh records the alert, but no n8n execution appears | The workflow is not published, or Wazuh is sending to the test URL | Publish the workflow and configure Wazuh to use the production Webhook URL |
